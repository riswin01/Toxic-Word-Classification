# Toxic-Word-Classification
Jigsaw dataset - Toxic word classification with Simple RNN, LSTM and GRU

Dataset sourced from a kaggle competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

The project does not aim at classifying comments among levels of toxicity, but instead focuses on a simpler task of classifying whether it is toxic or not.
And also, due to hardware constraints, the dimensions used from the GloVe word embeddings was 50d (50 dimensions). 

Possible future improvement:
- Use imported word embeddings at a higher dimension (300d for example)
- Dive into the task of further classifying toxicity into five types
